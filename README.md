================================

Map App taught to attendees of UIUC hackathon teck talk to introduce them into the world of iOS programming

This is the iOS app I created to teach the functionality of the Maps API of iOS programming to everyone that attended the HackIllinois iOS tech talk.
The app has functions such as showing a maps view with different view settings, shows current location, and alerts users when leaving a location.
